## The Task
Implement a ReactJS web app that will load a list of questions and provide the functionality for the user to reply to these questions and submit them all, once completed.

## The Implementation

Libraries used:
* React - for building the view layer
* Redux - for state management

## Steps to Run

* Clone the project
* run _**npm install**_
* run _**npm run web-prod**_ - this will create the _**bundle.js**_ and also start up an express server on port 3000

## Future Enhancements
- [ ] validations on the input submitted by user
- [ ] use the capability of the code framework and build a RN app sharing the business logic with the web-client
